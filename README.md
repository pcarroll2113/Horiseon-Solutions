# 01 HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

The webpage begins with a header at the top containing the Horiseon logo on the left and three links to the right. These links relate to the three sections of the main content.

The main content is separated into three rows in one column underneath the header. The three sections are named; Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing. 

To the right of the main content is an aside section made up of a sidebar containing icons and further descriptions of how Horiseon excels in Leadership, Brand Awareness and Cost Management.

Source code was provided by The Coding Bootcamp to be updated and consolidated for readability. Objectives included updating HTML elements to follow a logical semantic structure,  adding alt attributes to images to improve accessability and to organize, restructure and consolidate the CSS style sheet to follow best code practices and improve readability to fellow developers.

## Usage
Each of the three links in the header share a name with a section of the main content of the webpage. Clicking on these links will take you to the content below in the main section. Each section describes the ways that Horiseon can assist in online marketing needs in each respective area.

To run the code, clone index.html from [my repository](https://github.com/sillytsundere/Horiseon-Solutions.git) and open the index.html file in preferred code editor. You can also open the style.css document to observe the styling done to make the webpage easily readable and simple to navigate. Viewing the index.htm file in a live browser with DevTools allows for specific inspection of the integration of HTML and CSS elements.
